## üôá Why i made this?
> Widgets could be a great way to consume information passively

And what better information than the one thats actually gonna be useful for your final Chemistry exam!
I remember during my high school when i had to learn these elements; it was less of a memory and more of a scare. My teachers tried making us learn these elements using lots of acronyms but i still used to forget them; there were bloddy 118 of them during my time. 
A suggestion I got from my teacher was, take a big printout of the entire periodic table and stick it somewhere on the wall above your bed and spend 5 minutes reading through it before going off to sleep. 
Theoretically this suggestion was great but practically for me it proved quiet useless! I used to end up playing Call of Duty late at night with friends and sleep; spending the last 5 minutes before sleeping looking at the black mirror.

2. **Download** the [Periodic Table.js](./Periodic%20Table.js) script.
3.  **Transfer** the downloaded script to the "scriptable" folder on iCloud Drive which should have been created upon downloading of the app.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Feedback
If you have any feature request or feedback on this feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DharmiKumbhani) or mail me at <dharmikumbhani201@gmail.com>
widgets that can help us passively learn things should not be just limited to periodic tables; but to various other subjects as well, if you have any such idea in mind, feel free to reach out to me!

## üîÆ Future updates planned with this widget
Based on response and other time based factors my current plan includes:
- [ ] Change background color depending on light and dark mode
- [ ] Loop through all the elements in order one after the other
- [ ] Control the refresh rate, so one can set it to refresh element daily.
