<br/>

## 🙇 Why i made this?
I just came across scriptable and was intrigued by it. I have no idea about swift/objective-c but was working with javascript for quiet some time and thought this could be a great way to enter the realm of Automation and iOS development + i feel widgets are super cool!

<br/>

## 📖 How to use?
1. **Download** [scriptable app](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/scriptable/id1405459188).
2. **Download** the [Quotes.js](./Quotes.js) script.
3.  **Transfer** the downloaded script to the "scriptable" folder on iCloud Drive which should have been created upon downloading of the app.
4. **Long press** anywhere to enter the "jiggle mode" and click on "**+**" sign present on the top left of your screen. **Scroll down** until you find the Scriptable app and click on it.
5. Select widget size (preferable medium widget) and click on **[+ Add widget]**
6. Configure the newly added widget as [given below](#️-configure). 

<br/>
